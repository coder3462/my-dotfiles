    "readme": "# hyper-arc-dark-controls\nArc-themed window controls for [hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper)\n\nA plugin that makes the close, minimize, and maximize buttons look like the [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) Dark window controls, replacing the standard Windows 10-themed window controls. This plugin has been thoroughly tested in Ubuntu and Windows 10, and works with both `v1.4.8` (old stable) and `v2.0.0` canary and stable versions.\n\nBased on the original [Arc theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) source, this plugin aims to match the theme as much as possible. You're ~welcome~ encouraged to fork this project and modify it if you need to tinker with the colors, or create a PR if I missed something that needs fixing.\n\n![screenshot](https://dev.moso.io/hyper/hyper-arc-dark-controls/screenshot.png)\n\n\n### Note\n\nThis plugin is designed to work perfectly with the `hyperterm-atom-dark`-theme.\nWhile it also integrates fine with vanilla-themed hyper, I cannot take every theme and plugin into account.\nIf the plugin doesn't look great on `xyz`-theme, then please do create an issue and I will look into it. But since I don't own a Mac, I cannot test the plugin on every OS, although it's been tested on Linux and Windows 10 which is what I have available.\n\n\n### Changelog\n**1.2.0**\n- Added `$arcDarkConfig` variables for better configurability\n- Added support for `showWindowControls`\n- Optimized code for hyper v2.x\n\n**1.1.8**\n- Fixed positioning of the window controls when tabs are active\n- Fixed tabs width while using flexbox\n\n**1.1.7**\n- Fixed wrong window controls offset on default theme\n- Reworked flexbox for better positioning, meaning less `position: absolute`\n- Adjusted width and height on both the `<li>`'s and the `svg` icons to match the Arc Dark theme\n\n**1.1.6**\n- Fixed hamburgerMenuLeft position issue\n\n**1.1.4, 1.1.5**\n- Adjusted the header hight to match the theme\n- Applied background color to the header to match the theme color\n- Adjusted some values to make the right areas show the background color\n- Adjusted the font and font-size of the window title\n\n**1.1.3**\n- Applied a small fix to the close button after a hyper update skewered its position.\n- Also made the close button smaller to better mimic the original close button.\n\n**1.1.2**\n- Small fix to adjust the height and width of the `li` with the maximize and minimize icons, to compensate for the added border.\n\n**1.1.1**\n- Small, unmentionable fixes regarding this README.\n\n**1.1.0**\n- Converted the originally forked `div` with `span`'s into an `ul` with inline `svg`'s residing inside its `li`'s. This allows for better control over the hover/active functions, and better control over the `fill`-property of the `svg`'s. While using `li`'s we also get past the ugliness of positioning each icon with `position: absolute`, and we now control the space between icons with margin instead. And we now also have the correct hover/active behaviour, since we now have the `background`-property on the `li`'s available aswell.\n- The `svg`'s used are taking directly from the original [Arc Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) repository. So all credit goes to [horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180). However, I've optimized them quite a bit by removing empty groups and useless InkScape/SodiPodi tags. It might even be worth a PR.\n- By inlining the `svg`'s, we can also get rid of the `/icons` folder aswell, as there's now no need for shipping the actual icons.\n\n**1.0.0**\n- Initial release\n\n### Install\n\n**Hyper store**\n```\nhyper i hyper-arc-dark-controls\n```\n\n**Manually**:\n\n1. Open hyper's preferences with `Ctrl+,` (or manually at `~/.hyper.js`) with your editor.\n2. Update your list of plugins to include hyper-arc-dark-controls, like so:\n\n        plugins: [\n            'hyper-arc-dark-controls'\n        ],\n\n3. Reload (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) or restart hyper and voila!\n\n**hpm (1.4.8)**:\n\n1. Install using `hpm i hyper-arc-dark-controls`\n2. Reload (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) or restart hyper and voila!\n\n### Configuration\n\nYou can configure the window controls like you would in your `~/.hyper.js`.\n\n- `showWindowControls: true` - default, will display the window controls to the right.\n- `showWindowControls: 'left'` - will display the window controls to the left in reverse order, like on a Mac.\n- `showWindowControls: false` - will disable the window controls, and only theme the header.\n\n\n### To Do\n- Config for lighter Arc themes.\n- Create a check to see if the window is focused, and add a class if not, so the window controls will be \"faded\" like on real window controls.\n\n### Related\n- [hyper-pocillo-controls](https://github.com/moso/hyper-pocillo-controls)\n- [hyper-dark-scrollbar](https://github.com/moso/hyper-dark-scrollbar)\n\n\n### License\n\n- The code is released under the MIT license\n- The inline SVGs are licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n",
